## Overview
This MRHS CTE Department Partnerships Database is a website that uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create a series of identity cards for each organization, a button to edit the content of each card, and a search bar to quickly locate information. The program will make it easier for the CTE Department to keep track of existing partners or locate appropriate partners to assist the CTE Department in its endeavours. 

## Features
* Card generating system that generates cards when new information is entered into the array.
* Search bar to filter and find information among the cards.
* Edit button to make the information cards editable.
* Saves the editted text into the computer's cookies.

## Usage
Click this link to get search the current database. Click the edit button to make small changes to the content, but to change an entire card, it is recommended to change the arrary directly. Click the edit button again to stop editing.

To create your own database, copy the files and change the code as it is suited.
